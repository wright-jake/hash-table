# hash-table
A collection of LeetCode solutions for hash table questions

Hash Tables are data structures we use to organise data using hash functions in order to support quick insertion and search

The idea is to use a hash function to map keys to buckets

One of the data structures we have is a hash set, this is a set where we store no repeated values, typically, we use these to check if a value has ever appeared or not

For most hashset questions we are looking for something like this:

      #create a hashset
      hashset = set()
      
      #iterate through list/array
      
      #check to see if value is in hashset
      
      #if not we can add to our hashset with
      hashset.add()
      
      #we can remove from our hashset
      hashset.remove()
      
      #and we can also pop values out of our hashset
      hashset.pop()
      
Another data structure we have is a hashmap, this is a map we use to store (key, value) pairs

There are a few scenarios where we might use these, i.e. when we need more information than just the key, if this is the case we want to build a mapping relationship between key and information needed using a hashmap

      #create a hashmap
      hashmap = {}
      
      #we can then use enumerate to return the index/count of iterations and the value associated with it
      for i, n in enumerate()
